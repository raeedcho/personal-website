# Raeed Chowdhury's personal website

This is the source code for my personal website, built using Quarto. In it's current state, it has very little changed from the default settings used by [Quarto's basic blog setup](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).

## Deployment
This site is deployed through Netlify using a GitHub Action that triggers on every push (basic setup [on Quarto's documentation site](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html)). DNS settings for the domain are on Cloudflare.
